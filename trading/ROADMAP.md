# Roadmap for Simbiot-trading-bot-full

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Remove all hardcoded values (stubs) from all modules.
- [x] Add logging via `setup_logging` to all modules.
- [x] Integrate `MarketData` for real-time data fetching from exchanges (Binance, Kraken).
- [x] Update all strategies in `strategies/` to use real data.
- [x] Restore and integrate `ui/` directory for visualization.
- [x] Add machine learning models in `models/` for predictions.
- [x] Implement backtesting and optimization in `learning/`.
- [x] Set up monitoring in `monitoring/`.
- [x] Document project architecture in `GRAPHICAL-MAP.md`.

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Conduct integration testing:
  - Run `start_trading_all.py` with multiple symbols and strategies.
  - Verify UI components (`dashboard.py`, `performance_charts.py`, `trade_visualizer.py`).
  - Check logs for errors and performance issues.
- [ ] Optimize performance:
  - Add caching in `MarketData` for frequently accessed data (e.g., symbol lists, klines).
  - Reduce latency in `TradeExecutor` by batching orders.

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Set up Telegram notifications:
  - Configure `telegram_notifier.py` with real bot token and chat ID.
  - Integrate notifications for trade events and alerts.
- [ ] Add new strategies:
  - Implement momentum-based strategy in `strategies/`.
  - Add multi-timeframe analysis support in strategies.
- [ ] Enhance UI:
  - Add real-time updating charts in `performance_charts.py`.
  - Develop a web-based dashboard using Flask or Django.
- [ ] Feature enhancements:
  - Integrate sentiment analysis using `social_media_fetcher.py`.
  - Implement advanced risk management in `risk_calculator.py` (e.g., dynamic stop-loss).
- [ ] Deploy the system:
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
  - Containerize with Docker.
  - Deploy to a cloud server (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean).

## Long-Term Goals
- Support more exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, KuCoin).
- Integrate advanced AI models (e.g., reinforcement learning) in `models/`.
- Build a community around the project for contributions and feedback.
- Create detailed API documentation and user guides in `docs/`.
