# Trading Bot Audit Results Map

## Overview
This document tracks the audit results and issues encountered during the development of the trading bot system, focusing on symbol selection, backtesting, live trading, self-learning, and scalability.

## Audit Results

### Issue 1: Timeout in `load_markets()` (Resolved)
- **Description**: Initial attempts to fetch symbols via `load_markets()` failed due to timeouts.
- **Resolution**: Added fallback to public API (`https://api.mexc.com/api/v3/exchangeInfo`) in `test_symbols.py`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 2: Incorrect API Response Handling (Resolved)
- **Description**: Public API response used `status: "1"` instead of `status: "ENABLED"`, causing empty symbol list.
- **Resolution**: Updated `test_symbols.py` to check for `status: "1"` and `isSpotTradingAllowed: true`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 3: Multiple Exchange Instances (Resolved)
- **Description**: System created multiple exchange instances, leading to performance issues.
- **Resolution**: Passed a single `exchange` instance to `validate_symbol`, `analyze_token`, and `fetch_ohlcv` in `test_symbols.py`, `symbol_handler.py`, `token_analyzer.py`, and `ohlcv_fetcher.py`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-01

### Issue 4: Strict Filtering Criteria (In Progress)
- **Description**: No symbols passed filtering due to strict criteria (volume, volatility, signals).
- **Resolution**: Reduced `min_volume_threshold` to 10, `min_volatility_threshold` to 0.01%, and temporarily disabled signal filtering in `test_symbols.py`. Added detailed logging to `validate_symbol` to diagnose validation failures.
- **Date**: 2025-04-02

### Issue 5: Duplicate API Calls (Resolved)
- **Description**: System made duplicate API calls to fetch symbols for each user.
- **Resolution**: Added symbol caching in `test_symbols.py` to avoid duplicate API calls.
- **Date**: 2025-04-02

### Issue 6: Missing Dependencies (Resolved)
- **Description**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sklearn'` in `retraining_manager.py`.
- **Resolution**: Installed `scikit-learn` and `joblib` in the virtual environment and updated `requirements.txt`.
- **Date**: 2025-04-02

## Planned Changes for Self-Learning, Self-Development, and Scalability

### Planned Change 1: Improve Self-Learning
- **Description**: Enhance self-learning with advanced models (LSTM, reinforcement learning) and more training features (indicators, correlations, news).
- **Files**: `retraining_manager.py`, `ml_data_preparer.py`.
- **Status**: Planned.

### Planned Change 2: Enhance Self-Development
- **Description**: Add adaptation of all trading parameters (leverage, trade_percentage, margin_multiplier) and implement parameter optimization using genetic algorithms.
- **Files**: `start_trading_all.py`, `strategy_optimizer.py`.
- **Status**: Planned.

### Planned Change 3: Market X-Ray Enhancements
- **Description**: Add additional indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR), symbol correlations, and news analysis.
- **Files**: `signal_generator_indicators.py`, `market_analyzer.py`, `news_analyzer.py`.
- **Status**: Planned.

### Planned Change 4: Scalability for 1000+ Users
- **Description**: Optimize Redis, test with 1000+ users, and add rate limiting for API requests.
- **Files**: `exchange_pool.py`, `main.py`.
- **Status**: Planned.

### Planned Change 5: Telegram Notifications
- **Description**: Add Telegram notifications for trades and errors.
- **Files**: `notification_manager.py`.
- **Status**: Planned.

## Current Status
- As of 2025-04-02, the system is in the symbol filtering phase, processing 2586 symbols in batches of 50.
- Filtering criteria have been relaxed (min_volume_threshold=10, min_volatility_threshold=0.01%), and signal filtering is temporarily disabled to allow more symbols to pass.
- Estimated completion of filtering: ~8.5 minutes (52 batches at ~10 seconds per batch).
- Basic backtesting and live trading functionality have been implemented, awaiting valid symbols to proceed.

## Next Steps
- Monitor filtering progress and check for valid symbols.
- Proceed to backtesting and live trading once valid symbols are found.
- Improve self-learning with advanced models (LSTM, reinforcement learning).
- Enhance training data with more features (indicators, correlations, news).
- Add strategy parameter adaptation and optimization.
- Optimize for scalability (Redis, rate limiting, 1000+ user testing).
- Add market x-ray features (indicators, correlations, news analysis).
- Integrate full AI capabilities (reinforcement learning, neural networks, clustering).
- Add Telegram notifications for monitoring.
