# Trading Bot Project Map

## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for the trading bot system, focusing on trading functionality, symbol selection, backtesting, live trading, self-learning, and scalability.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Initial Setup and Symbol Fetching (Completed)
- [x] Set up project structure and initial files.
- [x] Implement basic logging (`logging_setup.py`).
- [x] Fetch symbols from MEXC via `load_markets()` (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add fallback to public API for symbol fetching (`test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 2: Symbol Filtering and Validation (Completed)
- [x] Implement symbol validation (`symbol_handler.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by volatility and volume (`token_analyzer.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add filtering by trading signals (RSI) (`signal_generator_indicators.py`, `signal_generator_core.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Optimize exchange instance usage to avoid multiple creations (`test_symbols.py`, `symbol_handler.py`, `token_analyzer.py`, `ohlcv_fetcher.py`).
- [x] Add parallel symbol filtering in batches (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add debug logging to track filtering process (`logging_setup.py`, `test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add symbol caching to avoid duplicate API calls (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Add detailed logging to `validate_symbol` and relax filtering criteria (`symbol_handler.py`, `test_symbols.py`).

### Milestone 3: Backtesting and Live Trading (In Progress)
- [x] Implement basic backtesting for selected symbols (`backtest_cycle.py`).
- [x] Implement basic live trading with symbols that pass backtest (`start_trading_all.py`, `bot_trading.py`).
- [ ] Monitor trading performance and log results.

### Milestone 4: Self-Learning and Self-Development (In Progress)
- [x] Implement trade pool storage and synchronization with user cache (`trade_pool_manager.py`, `bot_user_data.py`, `cache_utils.py`).
- [x] Add data collection for training (`data_collector.py`).
- [x] Implement basic model retraining on trade pool data using RandomForestRegressor (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [x] Add dynamic signal generation (`signal_generator_dynamic.py`).
- [x] Implement market condition analysis for dynamic thresholds (`market_analyzer.py`).
- [x] Add dynamic threshold adjustment in symbol filtering (`test_symbols.py`).
- [ ] Improve self-learning with advanced models (LSTM, reinforcement learning) (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Enhance training data with more features (indicators, correlations, news) (`ml_data_preparer.py`).
- [ ] Add strategy parameter adaptation based on model predictions (`start_trading_all.py`).
- [ ] Implement parameter optimization using genetic algorithms (`strategy_optimizer.py`).

### Milestone 5: Scalability for 1000+ Users (In Progress)
- [x] Add pre-filtering of symbols by volume (`test_symbols.py`).
- [x] Implement exchange instance pooling (`exchange_pool.py`).
- [x] Add asynchronous user processing for multiple users (`main.py`).
- [ ] Optimize Redis for scalability (e.g., clustering, memory limits).
- [ ] Test system with 1000+ users.
- [ ] Add rate limiting for API requests (`exchange_pool.py`).

### Milestone 6: Market X-Ray Enhancements (Planned)
- [ ] Add additional indicators (Bollinger Bands, ATR) (`signal_generator_indicators.py`).
- [ ] Implement symbol correlation analysis (`market_analyzer.py`).
- [ ] Integrate news analysis for market events (`news_analyzer.py`).

### Milestone 7: Full AI Implementation (Planned)
- [ ] Integrate reinforcement learning for strategy optimization (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Add neural networks for price/signal prediction (`retraining_manager.py`).
- [ ] Implement unsupervised learning for symbol clustering (`market_analyzer.py`).

### Milestone 8: Enhancements and Notifications (Planned)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for trades and errors (`notification_manager.py`).
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components.

## Current Status
- As of 2025-04-02, the system is in the symbol filtering phase, processing 2586 symbols in batches of 50.
- Filtering criteria have been relaxed (min_volume_threshold=10, min_volatility_threshold=0.01%), and signal filtering is temporarily disabled to allow more symbols to pass.
- Estimated completion of filtering: ~8.5 minutes (52 batches at ~10 seconds per batch).
- Basic backtesting and live trading functionality have been implemented, awaiting valid symbols to proceed.

## Next Steps
- Monitor symbol filtering progress and ensure valid symbols are selected.
- Proceed to backtesting and live trading once valid symbols are found.
- Improve self-learning with advanced models (LSTM, reinforcement learning).
- Enhance training data with more features (indicators, correlations, news).
- Add strategy parameter adaptation and optimization.
- Optimize for scalability (Redis, rate limiting, 1000+ user testing).
- Add market x-ray features (indicators, correlations, news analysis).
- Integrate full AI capabilities (reinforcement learning, neural networks, clustering).
- Add Telegram notifications for monitoring.
